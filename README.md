2. __Project Description__:  
As the toughest privacy and security law in the world, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is applied on a large scale of web applications to protect the EU citizens. Due to the detailed and complicated contents, programmers need to spend a lot of time on following these regulations which increases the development costs. In this project, we decide to implement a backend template of web applications for those who have demands on web application development compliant with the GDPR. Our goal is to build an automated backend to handle all users’ data during the data lifecycle (capture, store, use, destroy), which strictly follows the regulations. Using our template, developers can save the time cost of studying the GDPR and manage the users’ data by simple API calls.
Our expected outcome for this project is to
   * Establish a generalized web application backend template compliant with the GDPR ( Node.js & MongoDB )
   * Implement real backend codes for two specific scenarios as the test cases to validate our designed template actually works
